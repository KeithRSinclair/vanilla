This was supposed to be my Portfolio App, I used this to test out hosting it on my own servers at home, 
but I was way to paranoid about security so I scrapped the whole project all together.
I realized its easier to host on dedicated hosting sites or even right here on Github.
This project can be viewed at https://keithrsinclair.github.io/vanilla/ Note that there is no functionality to this site.
